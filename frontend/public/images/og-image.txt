Please replace this text file with an actual image file named "og-image.png" with dimensions of 1200x630 pixels.

The image should:
1. Include your logo
2. Have a clean, visually appealing design
3. Include a brief tagline like "Write it Once. Echo it Forever."
4. Use your brand colors

Once created, make sure to update the meta tags in the Layout.tsx file if you use a different filename or format.
